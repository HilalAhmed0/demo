            <p>India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[23] is a country in South Asia. It is
                the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy
                in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of
                Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China, Nepal, and Bhutan
                to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of
                Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand,
                Myanmar and Indonesia.
                <br><br>
                Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[24][25][26]
                Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region
                highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[27] Settled life emerged on the
                subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into
                the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[28] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit,
                an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest,[29][30] unfolding as the language
                of the Rigveda, and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India.[31] The Dravidian languages of India
                were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[32] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by
                caste had emerged within Hinduism,[33] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders
                unlinked to heredity.[34] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta
                Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[35] Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging
                creativity,[36] but also marked by the declining status of women,[37] and the incorporation of
                untouchability into an organised system of belief.[g][38] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported
                Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[39]
                <br><br>
                In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism put down roots on India's
                southern and western coasts.[40] Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern
                plains,[41] eventually establishing the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the
                cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[42] In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a
                long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[43] In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting
                institutionalised religion.[44] The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative
                peace,[45] leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[h][46] Gradually expanding rule of the British
                East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its
                sovereignty.[47] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted
                slowly,[48][49] but technological changes were introduced, and ideas of education, modernity and the
                public life took root.[50] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted
                for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[51] In 1947 the British
                Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions, a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a
                Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.[52]

                India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed in a democratic parliamentary system. It is a
                pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to
                1.211 billion in 2011.[53] During the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64
                annually to US$1,498, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute
                country in 1951,[54] India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology
                services, with an expanding middle class.[55] It has a space programme which includes several planned or
                completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing
                role in global culture.[56] India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of
                increasing economic inequality.[57] India is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military
                expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the
                mid-20th century.[58] Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child
                malnutrition,[59] and rising levels of air pollution.[60] India's land is megadiverse, with four
                biodiversity hotspots.[61] Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area.[62] India's wildlife, which has
                traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's culture,[63] is supported among these forests, and
                elsewhere, in protected habitats.

             <p> Main article: Names of India
             
             According to the Oxford English Dictionary (third edition 2009), the name "India" is derived from the Classical Latin India, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east; and in turn derived successively from: Hellenistic Greek India ( Ἰνδία); ancient Greek Indos ( Ἰνδός); Old Persian Hindush, an eastern province of the Achaemenid empire; and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit Sindhu, or "river," specifically the Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.[64][65] The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi (Ἰνδοί), which translates as "The people of the Indus"
             <br>
             
             The term Bharat (Bhārat; pronounced [ˈbʱaːɾət] (audio speaker iconlisten)), mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of India,[67][68] is used in its variations by many Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical name Bharatavarsha, which applied originally to northern India,[69][70] Bharat gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.[67][71] <br>
             
             Hindustan ([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn] (audio speaker iconlisten)) is a Middle Persian name for India, introduced during the Mughal Empire and used widely since. Its meaning has varied, referring to a region encompassing present-day northern India and Pakistan or to India in its near entirety.[67][71][72]

            <span>By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[24][25][26] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[24] After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan, Pakistan.[74] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[75][74] the first urban culture in South Asia,[76] which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in what is now Pakistan and western India.[77] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging

                    During the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[78] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[79] were composed during this period,[80] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[78] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[79] The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.[81] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[78] In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[82] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[82]</span><br>

                 <p>In the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas.[89][90] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[91] Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[92][93][94] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[95] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire.[96] The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[97][98] The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.[99][100]</p><br>
                 <p>The Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and South-East Asia.[101][102] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.[103][96] By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.[104][105] Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself.[106] This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.[105] Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.[105]</p>
